                    <i>March 2023 – June 2023</i>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px; text-align:justify;">
                        We investigated the relationship between input slew variation and the statistical distribution of cell delay in on-chip variations. 
                        While constructing the nominal model for cell delay, we adopted a piecewise function approximation curve that includes a logarithmic function to represent the input voltage curve. 
                        This approach enabled the unified algebraic solution of output voltage for each unit level. 
                        Building upon this, we analyzed the partial differential relationships between variances concerning cell delay, threshold voltage, and input slew for more accurate statistical cell/path delay modeling.

                        We used template matching and filters to recognize cones in in-car perspective video frames, then designed a function with the speed and the steering of the car to predict the movement of cones.
                        Based on that we constructed optimization models to calibrate GPS locations of the track according to the difference of relative positions between the cones and the car.

                    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px; text-align:justify;">
                        We established a timing analysis and optimization framework for NTV circuit design by leveraging the interdependency between the setup/hold time and clock-to-q delay for flip-flops to improve circuit performance without any additional area and power cost.
                        To accomplish it, we proposed an iterative circuit optimization method by integrating the ANN-based interdependent timing model into STA flow to minimize the clock period without any timing violations by balancing the timing slacks among iteratively selected paths.

                    I am an ardent fan of classical music, and my journey with this timeless genre began at the age of 7 when I was captivated by the enchanting works of the Strauss Family. As the years passed, I explored from the symphonies of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Dvorak, to the grandeur of Bruckner and Mahler's orchestral pieces. Wagner's operas, particularly Lohengrin, and the beautiful melodies of Italian operas like Aida, The Lady of the Camellias, Cavalleria Rusticana, and Pagliacci, have also left a lasting impression on me. Additionally, I am well-acquainted with the ballets of Chaikovsky and Stravinsky, and I hold a special admiration for conductors like Jansons, Abbado, Barbirolli, Simon Rattle, and Celibidache for their masterful interpretations of symphonic and vocal works. My love for classical music is boundless, and its richness continues to inspire me as I explore and appreciate various masterpieces and the talented musicians who bring them to life.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:16px">
                    In the realm of sports, my passion for football began during middle school, and in university, I proudly played as a center back for my department team, competing in the department cup for three years. As a devoted fan, I support Borussia Dortmund and the Germany national football team. Additionally, I enjoy watching Formula 1 races, where my admiration lies with Max Verstappen and Oracle Red Bull Racing, as well as drivers like Fernando Alonso and Zhou Guanyu. In Snooker, I am enthralled by Judd Trump's amazing skills and Mark Selby's strategic brilliance. While I may not be as well-versed in other sports, I remain curious and open to exploring various athletic disciplines.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:16px">
                    In addition to my love for classical music and sports, I am an avid movie enthusiast. My movie-watching list spans a wide spectrum, from classics such as the Godfather series and the Star Wars series to more contemporary gems like Pixar animations. Recently, I had the delightful experience of recognizing all the characters featured in Shanghai Disneyland's Fireworks & Nighttime Entertainment. In my opinion, movies represent a harmonious collaboration of various art forms and showcase the impressive strength of modern engineering.</p>

                    Although my TOEFL score in my CV reflects my proficiency as of 2021, my English skills have significantly improved since then. I have also been actively studying German since June 2023, mastering all basic grammar and acquiring vocabulary related to several life scenarios.</p>
