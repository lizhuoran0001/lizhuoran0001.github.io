                    <i>March 2023 – June 2023</i>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px; text-align:justify;">
                        We investigated the relationship between input slew variation and the statistical distribution of cell delay in on-chip variations. 
                        While constructing the nominal model for cell delay, we adopted a piecewise function approximation curve that includes a logarithmic function to represent the input voltage curve. 
                        This approach enabled the unified algebraic solution of output voltage for each unit level. 
                        Building upon this, we analyzed the partial differential relationships between variances concerning cell delay, threshold voltage, and input slew for more accurate statistical cell/path delay modeling.

                        We used template matching and filters to recognize cones in in-car perspective video frames, then designed a function with the speed and the steering of the car to predict the movement of cones.
                        Based on that we constructed optimization models to calibrate GPS locations of the track according to the difference of relative positions between the cones and the car.

                    <i>August 2021 – October 2022</i>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px; text-align:justify;">
                        We established a timing analysis and optimization framework for NTV circuit design by leveraging the interdependency between the setup/hold time and clock-to-q delay for flip-flops to improve circuit performance without any additional area and power cost.
                        To accomplish it, we proposed an iterative circuit optimization method by integrating the ANN-based interdependent timing model into STA flow to minimize the clock period without any timing violations by balancing the timing slacks among iteratively selected paths.
